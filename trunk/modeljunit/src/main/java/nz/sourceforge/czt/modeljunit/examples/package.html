    <h1>Examples of Using ModelJUnit</h1>

    <p>
    This package contains several simple examples of ModelJUnit models 
    and test adaptors (the test harness/driver code that links the
    model to the system under test).
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>SimpleSet.</strong>  This is a very abstract (simplified)
         model of a set of elements.  To simplify the testing, this model
         assumes that two elements is enough to test the set operations.
         It is only a model (contains no adaptor code), but it could be
         used to generate offline tests.</li>

      <li><strong>SimpleSetWithAdaptor.</strong>
         This is the same as SimpleSet, but with some adaptor code added
         so that it does online testing of a <code>Set&lt;String&gt;</code>
         implementation whenever you generate tests from it.
         Pass any <code>Set&lt;String&gt;</code> object into the constructor
         to test it.</li>

      <li><strong>LargeSet.</strong>
         This is a more complex model than SimpleSet, because it models
         up to 13 independent members of the set.  The model is 
         parameterized so that you can create models for any size of set
         from 1 to 13 elements.  However, with 10 elements, this model has
         1024 states and 20480 transitions, which would take a long time
         to test exhaustively.  See SmartSetAdaptor for a better approach.
         </li>

      <li><strong>SmartSetAdaptor.</strong>
         This illustrates how you can use inheritance to add adaptor code.
         This class extends SimpleSet and adds the adaptor code that
         interacts with the SUT (online testing).  It also illustrates how you
         can do abstraction within the adaptor code.  The adaptor code maps
         the model variable <code>s1</code> to a single string (as in
         SimpleSetWithAdaptor), but maps the model variable <code>s2</code>
         to a large number of strings.  This achieves the goal of testing
         the SUT with a large number of elements, but still keeps the model
         small (4 states and 16 transitions) so that it can be tested
         quickly and thoroughly.</li>

      <li><strong>StringSet and StringSetBuggy.</strong>  These are
         example implementations of <code>Set&lt;String&gt;</code>,
         which you can use to experiment with executing the tests
         generated from the above models.  For example, if we pass
         a StringSet object to SimpleSetWithAdaptor it passes all the
         tests, while if we pass StringSetBuggy it fails the tests.</li>

      <li><strong>FSM.</strong>  This is a trivial nonsense model with
         just three states, one of which is a terminal state.
         A graphical view of this simple model can be seen on the
         <a href="http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/~marku/mbt/modeljunit">ModelJUnit
         web page.</a>
         </li>

      <li><strong>QuiDonc.</strong>  This is a simple model of the
         France Telecom service that lets you enter a phone number
         and find out the name and address of the person who owns
         that phone number.  This example is discussed in detail
         in our book, 
         <a href="http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/~marku/mbt">"Practical 
         Model-Based Testing: A Tools Approach".</a>
         </li>
         
      <li><strong>ECinema.</strong>  The <code>ecinema</code> subdirectory
         contains a model of a simple web-based cinema ticket booking system.
         </li>
         
      <li>strong>GSM 11-11.</strong>  The <code>gsm</code> subdirectory
         contains a model of a subset of the GSM 11-11 protocol that is used
         is communicate with the SIM chip within many mobile phones.  There
         is also a sample implementation of a simulated SIM chip that can
         be used as the system under test.  It is interesting to use
         this to measure the code coverage and mutation score of the
         generated test suites, as well as the model coverage.
    </ul>
