/**
 * An object of this class gets thrown when topological information related

 * exception is not intended to replace the

 * which covers cases where the vertex passed to a function is null, or
 * of a different implementation class, or from a different container.
 * 
 * For example, an <code>InvalidVertexException</code> is thrown
 * from <code>InspectableGraph.opposite(v,e)</code> when
 * <code>v</code> is not an endpoint of <code>e</code>.
