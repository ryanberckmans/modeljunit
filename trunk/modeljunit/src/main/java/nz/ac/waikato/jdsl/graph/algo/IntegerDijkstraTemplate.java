/**
 * Implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm using the template-method
 * pattern: the core functionality is coded in a few final methods
 * that call overridable methods to do some of the work.  The methods
 * of this class are in five categories:
 *
 * <ul>
 * 
 * <li>A method you must override to make the compiler happy: You must
 * override weight(Edge) to supply the algorithm with a weight for
 * every edge in the graph.  Note that Dijkstra's algorithm cannot
 * handle negative-weight edges.
 * 
 * <li>"Hook" methods that may be overridden to specialize the
 * algorithm to the application at hand: shortestPathFound(.),
 * edgeRelaxed(.), and vertexNotReachable(.).  For every vertex in the
 * graph (or every vertex you allow the algorithm to consider), either
 * shortestPathFound(.) or vertexNotReachable(.) will be called, and
 * will be called exactly once.  When that has occurred, the vertex is
 * considered to be "finished"; it will not be considered again by the
 * algorithm.  Finally, edgeRelaxed(.) will be called every time an
 * edge to an unfinished vertex is explored.
 * 
 * <li>Overridable methods that will need to be overridden more
 * rarely: See the comments for shouldContinue(), isFinished(.),
 * setLocator(.), getLocator(.), setEdgeToParent(.), newPQ(),
 * initMap(), incidentEdges(.), destination(.), vertices(), and
 * init(.) (which has a split role between this category of methods
 * and the next).
 *
 * <li>"Output" methods through which the user can test, after the
 * execution of the algorithm, whether a vertex is reachable from the
 * source, and retrieve the decorations of the vertices: See the
 * comments for isReachable(.), distance(.), and getEdgeToParent(.).
 * 
 * <li>Methods composing the core of the algorithm, which cannot be
 * overridden (or, in the case of init(.), should rarely be
 * overridden): You can run the algorithm in either of two ways.  If
 * you want to run the whole algorithm at once, use either version of
 * executeAll(.).  It will call doOneIteration() multiple times, and
 * doOneIteration() will call your overridden output methods as it
 * encounters vertices.  Instead of using executeAll(.), you can
 * single-step the algorithm by calling init(.) to initialize, then
 * calling doOneIteration() repeatedly.
 *
 * </ul>
 * 
 * Note that it is possible to confuse the algorithm by doing things
 * like modifying the graph, messing with the priority queue, or
 * changing edge weights while it is running.
