/** 
 * This is the class from which all exceptions of the core package are
 * descended.<p>
 * 
 * CoreExceptions (and its subclasses) can now take a "cause" to enhance the
 * stack trace. This should be used if a low-level exception was caught, but
 * could not be resolved -- so a higher-level exception (this) was thrown.
 * The cause of an exception can be any throwable object.
 * 	
 * If you want the compiler to help you check special cases that you might
 * have missed, copy all the exceptions to your own directory, change
 * "extends RuntimeException" to "extends Exception," modify your
 * CLASSPATH to look first at your own directory, later here.
 * When you compile again, the compiler will give you a huge number of
 * "Exception must be caught or declared as thrown" errors, a small
 * fraction of which will point to special cases you have overlooked.<p>
