/**
 * Implementation of the algorithm of Prim and Jarnik for finding a
 * minimum spanning tree, using the template-method
 * pattern:  the core functionality is coded in a few final methods
 * that call overridable methods to do some of the work.  The methods
 * of this class are in four categories:
 * <ul>
 * 
 * <li>a method you must override to make the compiler happy:  
 * You must override weight(Edge) to supply the algorithm with a
 * weight for every edge in the graph.  Note that the Prim-Jarnik
 * algorithm cannot handle negative-weight edges.
 * 
 * <li>"output" methods that you must, realistically speaking, override
 * in order to get useful information out of the algorithm and into
 * your application domain:  You will need
 * to override at least one of treeEdgeFound(.), relaxingEdge(.),
 * and vertexNotReachable(.).  For every vertex in the graph (or
 * every vertex you allow the algorithm to consider), either
 * treeEdgeFound(.) or vertexNotReachable(.) will be called, and
 * will be called exactly once.  When that has occurred, the vertex is
 * considered to be "finished"; it will not be considered again by the
 * algorithm.  Finally, relaxingEdge(.) will be
 * called every time an edge to an unfinished vertex is explored.
 * 
 * <li>overridable methods that will need to be overridden only
 * for special applications:  See the comments for shouldContinue(),
 * setLocator(.), getLocator(.), newPQ(), initMap(), incidentEdges(.),
 * destination(.), allVertices(), and init(.) (which has a split role
 * between this category of methods and the next).
 * 
 * <li>methods composing the core of the algorithm, which cannot be
 * overridden (or, in the case of init(.), should rarely be overridden):
 * You can run the
 * algorithm in either of two ways.  If you want to run the whole
 * algorithm at once, use either version of executeAll(.).  It will call
 * doOneIteration() multiple times, and doOneIteration() will call
 * your overridden output methods as it encounters vertices.  Instead
 * of using executeAll(.), you can single-step the algorithm by
 * calling init(.) to initialize, then calling doOneIteration() repeatedly.
 * </ul>
 * 
 * Note that it is possible to confuse the algorithm by doing things
 * like modifying the graph, messing with the priority queue, or changing
 * edge weights while it is running.
