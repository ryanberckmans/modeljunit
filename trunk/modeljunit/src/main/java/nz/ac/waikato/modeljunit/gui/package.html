    <h1>A GUI for ModelJUnit</h1>

    <p>
    This package contains a simple graphical user interface for
    ModelJUnit.  After you have written your model, it allows you
    to generate and execute tests by pointing and clicking.
    You can also use this GUI to generate the code that
    does this, and then you can copy that code into a JUnit
    test method so that your model-based testing will be done
    every time your unit tests are run.
