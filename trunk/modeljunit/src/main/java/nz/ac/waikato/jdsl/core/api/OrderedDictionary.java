/**
  * A Dictionary in which the keys are totally ordered. That is, given a set of
  * keys, <I>S</I>, where <I>a</I> and <I>b</I> are elements of <I>S</I>,
  * exactly one of the following properties holds:
  * <UL>
  *     <LI> <I>a</I> &lt; <I>b</I>
  *     <LI> <I>a</I> = <I>b</I>
  *     <LI> <I>a</I> &gt; <I>b</I>
  * </UL>
  * This extension of the concept of a dictionary allows ordered dictionaries to
  * be traversed through sequentially; the order is guaranteed to be the order
  * of the keys (except that no order is guaranteed for equal keys).
