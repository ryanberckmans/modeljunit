    <h1>Model Coverage Metrics</h1>

    <p>
    The classes in this package implement various metrics for
    measuring the coverage of the model when a test suite is generated.
    It is usually a good idea to use these metrics to check that
    you have generated enough tests to cover the majority of the
    behaviours of the model.  For small or medium sized models
    (up to 100 transitions), a good minimum metric is to monitor
    transition coverage and aim to cover 100% of the transitions.
    </p>

    <p>
    As well as using the metrics provided by this package to
    monitor model coverage, it is also wise to monitor the
    code coverage of your system under test (SUT) if possible.
    This can be done using standard profiling or coverage tools
    for Java, or you could use <a href="http://jumble.sourceforge.net">
    Jumble</a> (which mutates your SUT class and finds out how
    many of the possible mutations are caught by the tests).
    </p>

    <p>
    To use these coverage metrics, you create an instance of
    whichever coverage metric class you are interested in, then
    add it to your <code>ModelTestCase</code> object using the
    <code>addCoverageMetric</code> method.  Then generate some
    tests and the coverage metrics will be automatically recorded.
	</p>

	<p>
    The <code>ModelTestCase</code> class also provides methods
    for removing one or all coverage metrics and querying the
    current set of coverage metrics.
    These methods are static, to make it convenient to configure the
    same set of metrics for several different models and test suites.
    </p>

    <p>
    If you want to implement new coverage metrics, you must implement
    the <a
    href="net/sourceforge/czt/modeljunit/coverage/CoverageMetric.html">CoverageMetric</a>
    interface.  The <a
    href="net/sourceforge/czt/modeljunit/coverage/AbstractCoverage.html">AbstractCoverage</a>
    class is provided to make this easier.  It is a partial
    implementation of the CoverageMetric interface that maintains a
    map from <em>coverage objects</em> (for example, states or
    transitions or some new kind of object that you invent) to the
    number of times that coverage object has been traversed by the
    generated tests.
